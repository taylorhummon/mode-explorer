app running live at [https://scales.taylorhummon.com](https://scales.taylorhummon.com).

## Installation

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20.9 or higher. I recommend using 
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install a recent version of node. Here are its 
[installation instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script).

We'll be using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to track dependencies. Yarn is included with node, 
but you may need to [enable it](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

To install this application's dependencies, change into the project directory and run `yarn`:
```
cd mode-explorer/
